# Deep CNN Image Classifier for Chest X-ray Analysis

# Motivation

A Detailed analysis of Chest X-rays can assist in the early detection of various medical conditions, including respiratory diseases, cardiac issues, and most importantly, pulmonary abnormalities such as pneumonia. Early detection allows for prompt medical intervention, leading to better treatment outcomes and increased chances of recovery. In such a scenario, Image Classifier for Chest X-rays plays an important role in leveraging data analytics to optimize health care and improve the accuracy of medical dignostics.

# Synopsis


# Overview of the Input Dataset
The input dataset consits of 5,863 X-Ray images, divided into two main categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
These Anterior-posterior Chest X-ray images belong to patients aged one to five at Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou.

# Output
The output is a detailed Deep learning model that classifies images into two sub-clases.
